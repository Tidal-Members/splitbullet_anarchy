# Split Bullet: Anarchy
This repository is the source for ``Split Bullet: Anarchy``'s Workshop addon.

Split Bullet: Anarchy is the story mode for Split Bullet, a 2.5-dimensional shooter. You must learn to control your split personality to save the world from chaos.

This should be cloned into an addon folder, usually ``addons/splitbullet_anarchy/`` works best when uploading with GMAD to the Workshop.
